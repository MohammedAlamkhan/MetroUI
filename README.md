##Technical Preview

*Please note that this Technical Preview is for Desktop devices or Tablets only.*

Welcome to MetroUI
==================

A game-changing mobile app framework, driven by the powerful HTML5 and CSS3.

The key of MetroUI is absolute precision. Every feature, every detail looks and feels the same as Windows and Windows Phone.
Because Microsoft released design templates for new Store apps on both platforms, MetroUI has strict guidelines on how to look.

```

MetroUI is ready to use, but you can build it yourself if you want to change something.
As MetroUI is built with Grunt and Node, you need [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) as a prerequisite. Then you can create your build using these commands:

```shell
$ npm install
$ grunt build
```

You can find the output in `./build`

A distribution build can be created like this:

```shell
$ npm install
$ grunt dist
```

This includes a minified version of the JavaScript Core
